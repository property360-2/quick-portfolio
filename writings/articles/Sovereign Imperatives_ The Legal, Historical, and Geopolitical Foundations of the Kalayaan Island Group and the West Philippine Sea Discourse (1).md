# **Sovereign Imperatives: The Legal, Historical, and Geopolitical Foundations of the Kalayaan Island Group and the West Philippine Sea Discourse**

## **Introduction**

The geopolitical architecture of the South China Sea is defined by a complex, high-stakes intersection of historical narratives, international maritime jurisprudence, and the physical realities of territorial occupation. At the absolute center of this volatile maritime theater is the Kalayaan Island Group (KIG—sometimes erroneously referred to as KAG), a highly strategic cluster of maritime features situated in the western section of the Philippine archipelago. For several decades, the Republic of the Philippines has maintained a continuous, effective, and legally codified occupation of the KIG, asserting an indisputable claim of sovereignty over its land features and sovereign rights over its surrounding waters. However, the integrity of this territorial claim is routinely and aggressively challenged. These challenges emanate not only from the expansive and legally invalidated claims of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) but also, in highly disruptive instances, from internal legislative dissonance within the Philippine government itself.

In early February 2026, the national discourse surrounding the West Philippine Sea (WPS) and the Kalayaan Island Group was abruptly destabilized by a series of highly controversial remarks made by Philippine Senator Rodante Marcoleta, as widely reported by reliable media outlets including the *Philippine Daily Inquirer* and *ABS-CBN News*.7 During a sensitive legislative hearing involving the confirmation of senior military officials, and in subsequent media broadcasts, Senator Marcoleta floated the hypothetical surrender of the KIG. He cited the potential risks to Filipino lives and articulated a deeply flawed interpretation of Philippine maritime zones, attempting to artificially separate the Kalayaan Island Group from the nation's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). These statements triggered an immediate national security alarm, drawing intense, unified condemnation from maritime law experts, retired Supreme Court justices, and the national defense establishment.

This comprehensive, exhaustive research report critically examines the legal, historical, and demographic foundations that irrevocably establish the Kalayaan Island Group as sovereign Philippine territory, definitively refuting the historical claims of the PRC. By systematically deconstructing the timeline of Philippine occupation, the evolution of domestic maritime laws, and the binding 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award, this analysis provides an impenetrable defense of Philippine sovereignty. Furthermore, this report executes a forensic analysis of the inconsistencies and legal fallacies embedded in Senator Marcoleta’s speeches. It provides an exact accounting of his statements, the venues in which they were delivered, the platforms where they were broadcast, and the profound second- and third-order geopolitical implications of domestic disinformation and legislative miscalculation in the face of persistent foreign territorial aggression.

## **Part I: The Historical Imperative and the Perfection of Title**

The assertion of Philippine sovereignty over the Kalayaan Island Group is not a modern geopolitical contrivance designed merely to counter contemporary Chinese expansionism. Rather, it is the result of a documented historical progression grounded in the fundamental international legal doctrine of *effective occupation*. Unlike the historical rights claimed by China—which rely on ancient cartography and have been unequivocally invalidated by international tribunals—the Philippine claim is built upon the physical discovery of *terra nullius* (land belonging to no one), subsequent continuous administration, and permanent civilian habitation.

### **The Geopolitical Vacuum and Terra Nullius**

To understand the legal strength of the Philippine position, one must first analyze the status of the South China Sea features in the mid-20th century. Following the devastation of World War II and the dismantling of the Japanese Empire, which had briefly occupied various features in the South China Sea, a geopolitical vacuum emerged in the region. The islands, reefs, and shoals comprising what is now known as the KIG were largely uncharted, uninhabited, and devoid of any effective, continuous state administration. Under classical international law, territory that is not subject to the sovereignty of any state is considered *terra nullius*. A state can acquire sovereignty over *terra nullius* through the process of discovery followed by effective occupation—a legal principle famously cemented in international jurisprudence by the *Island of Palmas* case.

While China argues that it possessed historical rights to the Spratly Islands (which it refers to as the Nansha Islands) dating back to the Han and Song dynasties, international law dictates that historical discovery alone merely constitutes an "inchoate title". To perfect a claim of territorial sovereignty, the state holding an inchoate title must maintain a peaceful and continuous display of state authority over the territory. Prior to the 1970s, the physical presence of any state in the specific features of the KIG was sporadic at best and entirely absent at worst, setting the stage for private exploration.

### **Tomas Cloma and the Free Territory of Freedomland (1947–1956)**

The modern legal history of the KIG under the Philippine sphere of influence was initiated by the actions of a private citizen. In 1947, Tomas Cloma, a Filipino lawyer, adventurer, and maritime fishing magnate who later founded the Philippine Marine Institute (PMI Colleges), stumbled upon several uninhabited islands in the South China Sea, located approximately 380 miles (610 kilometers) west of the southern end of Palawan, as documented in the historical archives of the Kalayaan municipal government.11 Recognizing that these features were unoccupied and devoid of any established state administration, Cloma organized a series of maritime expeditions to formally claim them.

| Date | Action by Tomas Cloma and Associated Entities | Significance in Territorial Claim |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1947** | Initial discovery of the uninhabited island group by Tomas Cloma. | Identification of potential *terra nullius*. 1 |
| **May 11, 1956** | Cloma, accompanied by forty men, formally takes physical possession of the islands. | The act of physical occupation; naming the area the "Free Territory of Freedomland". 1 |
| **May 15, 1956** | Cloma issues and physically posts a "Notice to the Whole World" on each of the islands. | A decisive, documented manifestation of an unwavering claim over the territory to the international community. 1 |
| **May 31, 1956** | Formal declaration of the establishment of the Free Territory of Freedomland. | Consolidation of the private claim and notification to the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs. 1 |
| **July 6, 1956** | Cloma establishes a separate government for the territory. | Flat Island (Patag Island) is designated as the capital of the Free Territory of Freedomland. 1 |
| **September 24, 1956** | The Republic of China (ROC/Taiwan) intercepts Cloma's men and vessels. | The ROC garrisons the nearby island of Itu Aba in response to Cloma's actions, demonstrating the geopolitical friction caused by the discovery. 1 |

Cloma’s unilateral declaration fundamentally altered the geopolitical dynamics of the region. His actions were met with violent and unfriendly reactions from neighboring entities, most notably the Republic of China (ROC/Taiwan), which subsequently garrisoned the feature of Itu Aba and actively intercepted Cloma’s men.2 Despite these rising regional tensions, Cloma’s actions established the vital legal prerequisites of initial discovery and physical presence.

### **The Cession of Rights and the Institutionalization of State Control (1974–Present)**

Under international law, the discovery of territory by a private citizen yields only an inchoate title. To perfect this claim into absolute territorial sovereignty, a recognized state must absorb the claim and subsequently maintain a continuous and peaceful display of state authority over the territory.

This critical legal transition occurred during the administration of Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. Recognizing the strategic importance of the islands and the necessity to consolidate national borders amidst increasing regional posturing, the Philippine government moved to absorb Cloma's private claim. In 1974, after a period of political friction during which Cloma was imprisoned, he officially ceded all his rights and claims over the Free Territory of Freedomland to the Republic of the Philippines for the symbolic sum of one peso.1

This transfer of rights transformed a private maritime adventure into a sovereign state imperative. The Philippine government immediately moved to exercise effective occupation. The state deployed military personnel and established a continuous government presence, culminating in the formal military command structure authorized by President Marcos in March 1976 through Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1-76, which established the AFP Western Command in Palawan to secure the area.1

## **Part II: Demographic Consolidation and Civilian Administration**

The transition from an isolated military outpost to a functioning, demographically active civilian municipality is the ultimate manifestation of state sovereignty. Military occupation alone can be contested as an act of temporary belligerence; however, the establishment of civilian governance, the holding of democratic elections, and the provision of state social services to a permanent population serve as unassailable proof of internal political jurisdiction and sovereignty.

### **Geographical Composition of the Kalayaan Island Group**

The Kalayaan Island Group, strategically located at the northeastern section of the disputed Spratly Archipelago, encompasses a variety of notable maritime features. The territory claimed by the Philippines under the KIG designation is composed of both prominent islands and strategically vital reefs.

| Category | Specific Features within the Kalayaan Island Group |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Islands (Landmasses)** | Pag-asa Island, Lawak Island, Patag Island, Likas Island, Kota Island, Panata Island, Parola Island. |
| **Reefs and Shoals** | Ayungin Shoal (Second Thomas Shoal), Rizal Reef, Balagtas Reef, Mischief Reef, Reed Bank, Fiery Cross Reef. |

Among these features, Pag-asa Island is the largest landform, possessing an approximate land area of 37.2 to 37.6 hectares.3 Situated approximately 480 kilometers northwest of Puerto Princesa City, Pag-asa serves as the administrative nerve center of the Philippine presence in the region and acts as the sole barangay for the entire municipality.3

### **Demographic Trajectories and Civilian Enfranchisement**

Following the formal annexation of the territory, the Philippine government initiated a process of civilian enfranchisement. The demographic evolution of the municipality, concentrated entirely on Pag-asa Island, demonstrates the reality of Philippine civilian administration. While the population is small, it has shown resilience and state-supported growth.

| Philippine Census Year | Total Population (Municipality of Kalayaan) | Demographic Shift |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1990** | 50 | Early civilian population count. 2 |
| **2010** | 222 | Demographic plateau established. 2 |
| **2020** | 193 | Representing 100% of the municipality's population residing in Barangay Pag-asa. 2 |
| **2024** | 406 | Significant expansion driven by state-sponsored civilian settlement programs. 2 |

As recorded by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in its 2024 census, the population of Kalayaan stood at 406 individuals.22 This community consists of multi-generational families, including a youth demographic that fundamentally alters the nature of the state's obligations to the territory.

### **Infrastructure, Education, and Economic Development on Pag-asa Island**

The presence of a permanent civilian population necessitates the delivery of state social services. For over three decades following its annexation, the island of Pag-asa lacked formal educational infrastructure, forcing residents to send their children on arduous, day-long boat trips across 285 nautical miles of open sea to mainland Palawan.6

This critical gap was rectified on June 15, 2012, when the Pag-asa Elementary School officially opened.6 Initially operating out of a repurposed multi-purpose hall, the school began by serving kindergarten students after the local government successfully recruited a teacher from the mainland, facilitating the return of grade schoolers to the island.6 Today, as highlighted by the *Philippine Daily Inquirer*, Pag-asa Island hosts a functioning public school, a health clinic, and a dedicated fishing community of 400 residents.77

## **Part III: The Domestic Legal Architecture Codifying Philippine Sovereignty**

The physical occupation of the Kalayaan Island Group is buttressed by a highly sophisticated framework of domestic legislation. To address the exact legal architecture establishing Philippine ownership of the KIG, the following decrees and acts outline the state's unyielding position:

### **1\. Presidential Decree No. 1596: The Foundational Charter (1978)**

The absolute foundational legal document integrating the Kalayaan Island Group into the Philippine state apparatus is **Presidential Decree No. 1596**, signed into law by President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. on June 11, 1978\.1 Titled *"Declaring Certain Area Part of the Philippine Territory and Providing for Their Government and Administration,"* PD 1596 serves as the state's explicit assertion of sovereignty.

The decree established a massive polygonal boundary defined by specific geographic coordinates, encompassing the cluster of islands and islets west of Palawan.9 As explicitly declared by the Republic of the Philippines in Presidential Decree No. 1596, the legal justification rests on three distinct pillars 8:

* **Geological Continuity:** The area is a natural extension of the continental margin of the Philippine archipelago.8  
* **Effective Occupation (Terra Nullius):** The decree formally codifies that these areas "do not legally belong to any state or nation" but, by reason of history, "indispensable need," and "effective occupation and control established in accordance with international law," they must be deemed subject to the sovereignty of the Philippines.88  
* **Lapse of Competing Claims:** The document argues that claims by other states "have lapsed by abandonment and can not prevail over that of the Philippines on legal, historical, and equitable grounds".88

PD 1596 formally constituted the area as a distinct and separate municipality of the Province of Palawan, officially named "Kalayaan".8

### **2\. Republic Act No. 9522: The Archipelagic Baselines Law (2009)**

When the Philippines formally ratified the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1984, the state undertook a binding obligation to align its domestic laws with international standards.10 Under UNCLOS, states cannot draw arbitrary polygonal boxes across vast expanses of open ocean and claim the internal waters as absolute territory.

To cure this without surrendering land, the Philippine Congress passed **Republic Act No. 9522** on March 10, 2009\.10 As enacted by the Philippine Congress in Section 2 of RA 9522, the law explicitly addressed the status of the KIG, classifying it as a "Regime of Islands".1210

The law states: *"The baselines in the following areas over which the Philippines likewise exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction shall be determined as 'Regime of Islands' under the Republic of the Philippines consistent with Article 121 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS): (a) The Kalayaan Island Group as constituted under Presidential Decree No. 1596..."*.2710 This strategic maneuvering cemented the KIG's status under domestic law while maintaining UNCLOS compliance.

### **3\. Republic Act No. 12064: The Philippine Maritime Zones Act (2024)**

The legislative architecture reached its zenith with the enactment of the **Philippine Maritime Zones Act**, officially designated as **Republic Act No. 12064**, signed into law by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on November 7, 2024\.13

As codified by the Philippine Congress in RA 12064, the act definitively establishes the metes and bounds of Philippine maritime jurisdiction in strict alignment with the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal ruling.1313 Crucially, Section 2(b) of the Act mandates that all territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty, explicitly including the maritime features of the Kalayaan Island Group, possess their respective maritime zones.1414

Furthermore, Section 2 dictates that the maritime zones on the western side of the archipelago, including the Luzon Sea and the *"territorial seas of Bajo de Masinloc and the maritime features of the Kalayaan Island Group, shall be collectively called the West Philippine Sea"*.1414

## **Part IV: The Invalidation of the Chinese Historical Narrative**

China maintains that its sovereignty over the "Nansha Islands" (its nomenclature for the Spratly Islands) and related maritime rights are supported by historical evidence dating back to the Han and Song dynasties. However, under the prevailing tenets of international law, the mere historical discovery of a feature constitutes only an inchoate title.

### **The 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award**

The definitive legal reckoning occurred on July 12, 2016\. As definitively ruled by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in *The Republic of the Philippines v. The People's Republic of China* (PCA Case No. 2013-19), the arbitral tribunal constituted under UNCLOS issued a landmark ruling overwhelmingly in favor of the Philippines.1616 The tribunal determined that:

1. **Invalidation of the Nine-Dash Line:** China's claims to historic rights over the maritime areas inside the "nine-dash line" have no lawful effect if they exceed the entitlements provided by UNCLOS.1616  
2. **Rejection of the Island Group Concept:** UNCLOS does not provide for a group of islands, such as the Spratly Islands, to generate maritime zones collectively as a single unit.1616

### **Countering Disinformation Regarding the Arbitral Award and PD 1596**

A state-sponsored disinformation campaign falsely claims that the 2016 SCS Arbitration "abolished" Presidential Decree 1596 and erased the Philippines' claim of sovereignty over the KIG.18 As fact-checked and verified by *VERA Files*, this claim is categorically false.18 The Arbitral Tribunal's mandate was strictly limited to determining maritime rights under UNCLOS; the issue of *territorial sovereignty* over the land features was explicitly excluded from the case.1818 Therefore, the Award did not affect Philippine sovereignty over the KIG, and PD 1596 remains completely valid and effective.18

## **Part V: The Marcoleta Controversy: Exact Quotes and Video Evidence**

Despite the impregnable legal foundation supporting the Philippine position, the nation's strategic posture has been periodically undermined by internal political actors. The most severe recent manifestation occurred in early 2026, centering on the deeply flawed statements of Senator Rodante Marcoleta.

### **1\. The Commission on Appointments Hearing (February 4, 2026\)**

The controversy ignited during a highly sensitive congressional Commission on Appointments (CA) hearing on **February 4, 2026**.19

* **Location:** Padilla Room / Senate Session Hall, Philippine Senate.20  
* **Video Source:** According to the official livestreams broadcast publicly on YouTube by the **"House of Representatives"** channel (under the title "PRESS CONFERENCE (FEBRUARY 04, 2026)") and the **"Senate of the Philippines"** channel (under the title "Senate Session No. 42 (February 4, 2026)").2121  
* **The Statements:** During a hearing attended by dozens of uniformed military nominees, Marcoleta initiated a line of questioning that shocked the defense establishment.19 As reported by the *Philippine Daily Inquirer*, Marcoleta questioned why the government should *"sacrifice lives for KIG"* and suggested that, to *"make things easy,"* the country might simply *"give up"* the Kalayaan Island Group.1919 He further asked why the country should *"offer the lives of our children, and die for something that is not even within our exclusive economic zone (EEZ)"*.197

### **2\. The ANC Clarification Interview**

Following intense public backlash, Marcoleta appeared on various national broadcasts to claim his words were "deliberately abbreviated" and taken out of context.19 However, his attempts to clarify his stance only provided more documented evidence of his flawed geopolitical reasoning.

* **Video Source:** As documented in an interview broadcast on the ANC network and uploaded to the **"ANC" (ABS-CBN News)** YouTube channel.24  
* **Title:** *"On The Scene: Senator Rodante Marcoleta clarifies his remarks..."*.2424  
* **Exact Quote & Timestamp:** According to the video, at exactly **\[03:47\]** of the broadcast, while discussing the difficulty of maintaining a presence in the KIG amidst foreign encroachment, Marcoleta stated verbatim:*"Are we going to give it up? Are we going to lose lives just because we have to stay there?"* 2424

### **3\. "Sa Ganang Mamamayan" Broadcast (February 6, 2026\)**

Marcoleta continued to defend his stance on his own program, shifting his argument toward mapping and technicalities.

* **Date:** Friday, February 6, 2026\.25  
* **Exact Quote (Tagalog):** As reported by *ABS-CBN News*, he challenged his critics and stated verbatim:*"Paano ka ngayon makakagawa ng mapa ng West Philippine Sea pag isinama mo yung Kalayaan Island Group? Kaya hanggang ngayon, pinipilit ko, hinahamon ko sila eh."* 2525

### **Deconstructing the Legal Inconsistencies of the Senator's Posture**

Marcoleta's defense relies on artificially separating the KIG from the EEZ and the West Philippine Sea.24 By analyzing the laws outlined in Part III, the inconsistencies in Marcoleta’s logic are glaring:

1. **The Superiority of Sovereignty:** Marcoleta used the distinction between the KIG (territory under PD 1596\) and the EEZ (resource rights under UNCLOS) to downplay the importance of defending the KIG.24 He emphasized that the state exercises *sovereignty* over the KIG but only *sovereign rights* over the EEZ.24 However, in international law, territorial sovereignty is the absolute highest form of state authority. It is a severe logical paradox to suggest defending fishing rights in the EEZ while simultaneously floating the surrender of actual sovereign landmasses.  
2. **The Fallacy of the Map:** Marcoleta's claim that the WPS cannot be mapped with the KIG included completely ignores the explicit provisions of the recently passed **Republic Act 12064** (Philippine Maritime Zones Act). As explicitly stated in Section 2 of RA 12064, the territorial seas of the KIG features are enveloped within the legal definition of the West Philippine Sea.1414  
3. **Echoing Foreign Propaganda:** By asserting that the KIG falls outside a simplistic EEZ boundary and is therefore an indefensible liability, Marcoleta inadvertently mirrored Beijing's arguments. In January 2026, he had relayed complaints from the Chinese ambassador and even suggested that the Philippines "share" the West Philippine Sea with China.23 In 2025, as covered by *INQUIRER.net*, he claimed that the WPS "does not exist".77

## **Part VI: Institutional Rebuttals and Geopolitical Repercussions**

The reaction from the Philippine defense, legal, and executive establishments highlights the absolute unacceptability of Marcoleta's position within the framework of Philippine statecraft.

**Condemnation from Maritime Experts:** According to maritime law expert Atty. Jay Batongbacal in an interview with *ABS-CBN News*, Marcoleta’s remarks were "unacceptable" and indicative of "willful ignorance".257 Batongbacal warned that giving up the KIG would expose the entire western coast of the Philippines.7 Citing RA 12064, Batongbacal stated, "We even made it consistent with international law, which recognizes our right in the EEZ and yet he keeps saying, he keeps arguing that we don't have an EEZ".2525

**Rebukes from Lawmakers and Justices:** As reported by the *Philippine Daily Inquirer*, Senate President Pro Tempore Panfilo Lacson strongly rebuked the suggestion, stating that "Giving up the KIG is like giving up Luzon".7 Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio escalated the critique, suggesting that because Marcoleta was "following the Chinese position," he "should register as their foreign agent".77

**The Malacañang Response:** The executive branch performed rapid damage control. As clarified by Palace Communications Undersecretary Atty. Claire Castro during a Malacañang press briefing on February 9, 2026, while Marcoleta's statements technically did not constitute the crime of treason, they were highly problematic.2626 Reaffirming President Marcos Jr.'s commitment, Castro stated, "Wala pong anumang bahagi ng teritoryo natin o anumang interes ang isu-surrender sa anumang foreign power" (No part of our territory or any interest will be surrendered to any foreign power).2626

## **Conclusion**

The Kalayaan Island Group is undeniably, historically, and legally an irrevocable part of the sovereign territory of the Republic of the Philippines. This status is based on the rigorous application of modern international law: the initial discovery by Tomas Cloma, the continuous civilian occupation on Pag-asa Island, and the robust codification of these physical realities through Presidential Decree 1596, Republic Act 9522, and Republic Act 12064\. As recorded in the landmark 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the legal validity of China's expansive Nine-Dash Line has been systematically annihilated.16

Against this fortress of legal and historical evidence, the rhetoric of Senator Rodante Marcoleta represents a highly dangerous anomaly. By artificially divorcing the KIG from the broader defense of the West Philippine Sea, deliberately misinterpreting the hierarchy of territorial sovereignty, and publicly hypothesizing the surrender of sovereign land, Marcoleta engaged in a brand of legislative dissonance that directly imperils national security. The defense of the Kalayaan Island Group is not an elective geopolitical exercise; it is an absolute constitutional mandate.
